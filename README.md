# DevPool : The Bot for Assigning n' Slicing Contributors (Season of Code)

The bot with a mouth at Summer of Code. DevPool does not listen 
to any of your commands by itself and gets all its commands through a Redis 
stream that it has subscribed to. All your commands are captured by 
[Alfred - The Webhook Butler](https://github.com/Infinite-Sum-Games/alfred). 

Read more about him at his home repository!

## Command Workflows

### 1. `/assign` - Contributor ONLY Command

### 2. `/unassign` - Contributor ONLY Command
Use this command to un-assign yourself from an issue. Your must be previously 
registered as a participant into the Summer of Code portal for this command

the program.

### 3. `/bounty <amount> @github-username` - Maintainer ONLY Command
Use this command to give out a bounty to a contributor. Bear note, the bounty 
will be given only if the contributor is registered to the program. It would 
otherwise fail and the bot would return with an unhappy message :(

### 4. `/penalty <amount> @github-username` - Maintainer ONLY Command

same as the previously mentioned bounty command.

### 5. `/bug @github-username` - Maintainer ONLY Command

contributor to be eligible for the "bug-hunting" related achievement badges.

the contributor is eligible for the corresponding achievement badge.

allows a contributor to be eligible for documentation-related achievement 
badges.
